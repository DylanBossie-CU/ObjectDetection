# ObjectDetection
The content of this repository should prove feasibility of requirements laid out in the Requirements Matrix in the drive, as well as prove various critical elements.

Detect all CubeSats within the FOV
Compute the position and velocity of CubeSats within the FOV
Provide error for the position and velocity that satisfies the required error bounds in the matrix
Determine the launch time of the CubeSats within error bounds
Confirm the initial velocities of the CubeSats are within range
Perform multi-object tracking for the case of multiple CubeSats within FOV

Default image directory to be processed is defined in imageDirectory variable in EdgeOutlineDetection.m, program should be run from this script.
